# Readme

The purpose of this repository is to store transformed data that will be used for insight generation. We saved the details of the process in 'data_transformation.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook.

## Data 
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) provides a wide range of statistical data on Australia's economic, population, environmental, and social issues. The “Commuting Distance by Personal Characteristics” data, one of the data cubes within the “2071.0.55.001 - Census of Population and Housing: Commuting to Work - More Stories from the Census” collection from the ABS. This data contains information about distance travelled between a person's place of usual residence and place of work associated with personal characteristics such as gender, age, occupation, industry, and weekly income.

We transformed this ABS data to an easy-to-process format and saved it to a new CSV file called “transformed_data.csv” in this repository.
