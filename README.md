# About repository

The purpose of this repository is to transform the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data into a required format for data insight generation. The repository includes ABS data and Jupyter Notebook as well as the transformed data file.

The data “Commuting Distance by Personal Characteristics” is originally from “2071.0.55.001 - Census of Population and Housing: Commuting to Work - More Stories from the Census”  collection from ABS. This data collection includes an analysis of the commuting distance by Personal Characteristics in Australia in 2016.  The data is available at (https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/2071.0.55.0012016?OpenDocument)

The Jupyter Notebook is a written Python program language that reads the ABS data to transform into a required format for data insight generation.
